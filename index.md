# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, <br/> I'm Chin Wei.

### I'm a MSc psychology researcher at the University of Hull, with a focus on understanding interactions with Artificial Intelligence.

### Currently, I am focusing on using Bayesian Approaches to test the Artificial Intelligence Device User Acceptance (AIDUA) model, testing the reliability of the model across two different cultures. I am also currently theorizing a new construct of "Concern with AI", that could be potentially be influential in affecting AI Acceptance or Rejection.

<br>

I can usually be found in a programming IDE or reading.
I'm bullish on, and a big booster of:

- ðŸŒ¿ðŸ’š [@bazelbuild](https://github.com/bazelbuild/) and generally using functional principles to keep things sane. (I've open-sourced a few tools for the Bazel ecosystem, see [/projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects))
- Good old-fashioned books ðŸ“–. Two recent favourites are [_The Dispossessed_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13651.The_Dispossessed) and [_Shakespearean Tragedy_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/437318.Shakespearean_Tragedy)
- [Effective Altruism](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/6/20992100/peter-singer-effective-altruism-lives-you-can-save-animal-liberation). Helping, not harming. Doing, not having. Building, not consuming.
