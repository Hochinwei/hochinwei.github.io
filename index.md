# 👋🏼 Hi there, I'm Chin Wei!

 I'm a MSc psychology researcher at the [University of Hull](https://www.hull.ac.uk/), as part of the prestigious White Rose Doctoral Training Partnership [(WRDTP)](https://wrdtp.ac.uk/). 
 
 This means I’ll be continuing my academic journey here for my PhD, diving deeper into the fascinating intersection of Human-AI interaction. My primary research focus lies in understanding how we process AI-generated content — mainly keeping the human at the center of the conversation.

Before this, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Psychology at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, where I was honoured the title NTU President Research Scholar for two consecutive years, thanks to my work in the Undergraduate Research Experience on Campus [(URECA)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-research-experience-on-campus-(ureca)) programme. 

I had the opportunity to lead two independent, year-long research projects under the guidance of faculty mentors, solidifying my love for all things research. Currently, my MSc dissertation involves Bayesian multilevel modeling to explore AI acceptance across cultures — yes, I’m also a stats enthusiast! 📈

I have a growing passion for Bayesian approaches to psychological research and am keen to refine my statistical and coding skills during my PhD. Fun fact: this very website exists because I’ve been dabbling in coding! It's been a rewarding challenge, much like my other hobbies.

When I’m not immersed in data or drafting research papers, you’ll likely find me at the gym. I’ve been a fitness enthusiast for years, competing in sports like Muay Thai and canoe kayak sprinting during my younger days. These days, I’m focused on bodybuilding — because why not aim for both mental and physical gains?

Curious about my severe lack of ongoing research projects? Head over to the Blog Page for more details.
