Hi there! I’m currently pursuing an MSc in Social Research at the University of Hull as part of the prestigious White Rose Doctoral Training Partnership [(WRDTP)](https://wrdtp.ac.uk/). This means I’ll be continuing my academic journey here for my PhD, diving deeper into the fascinating intersection of Human-AI interaction. My primary research focus lies in understanding how we process AI-generated content — mainly keeping the human at the center of the conversation.

Before this, I completed my bachelor’s degree in Psychology at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. During my time there, I was honored to be named an NTU President Research Scholar for two consecutive years, thanks to my work in the Undergraduate Research Experience on Campus [(URECA)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-research-experience-on-campus-(ureca)) programme. I had the opportunity to laed two independent, year-long research projects under the guidance of faculty mentors, solidifying my love for all things research. Currently, my MSc dissertation involves Bayesian multilevel modeling to explore AI acceptance across cultures — yes, I’m also a stats enthusiast!

Speaking of stats, I have a growing passion for Bayesian approaches to psychological research and am keen to refine my statistical and coding skills during my PhD. Fun fact: this very website exists because I’ve been dabbling in coding! It's been a rewarding challenge, much like my other hobbies.

When I’m not immersed in data or drafting research papers, you’ll likely find me at the gym. I’ve been a fitness enthusiast for years, competing in sports like Muay Thai and canoe kayak sprinting during my younger days. These days, I’m focused on bodybuilding — because why not aim for both mental and physical gains?

Curious about my severe lack ongoing research projects? Head over to the Research Page for more details. Let’s stay connected as I navigate the world of Human-AI interaction, one data set at a time!
